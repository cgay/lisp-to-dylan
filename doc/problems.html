<H1>Pitfalls for Lisp to Dylan Conversion</H1>

Dylan and Common Lisp (which we abbreviate in this document as "Lisp")
are fairly similar languages, but it is not trivial to translate a
Lisp program into Dylan.  That is, if you want to take a Lisp program
"out of the box" and convert it to run 100% correctly in Dylan, you
would essentially need either write a Lisp interpreter in Dylan, or
write a Lisp to Dylan <I>compiler</I>, which would produce correct
(but not always easily human-readable) code.  Instead of doing either
of those, it would make more sense to link the Lisp code in to Dylan
using the foreign function interface.<p>

On the other hand, if you are interested in converting a Lisp program
to Dylan so that you can then further modify it, and if you are
willing to put in some manual work, then you want not a compiler, but
rather a <I>translator</I> or <I>converter</I>, which produces clean,
human-readable Dylan code, but which will need some hand editing.  The
program <I>LTD</I> (for <I>L</I>isp <I>T</I>o <I>D</I>ylan) is just
such a translator. <p>

In the following sections we describe the areas where the translation
can run into trouble.  

<H2><A NAME="nil">NIL versus ()</A></H2>

Lisp has a single object, written as either <TT>nil</TT> or
<TT>()</TT>, which serves the role of three distinct Dylan objects:
<TT>#f</TT> for false, <TT>#()</TT> for the empty list, and
<TT>#"nil"</TT> for the symbol whose name is "nil".  In Dylan, only
<TT>#f</TT> counts as false for conditional tests.  Our suggestion is
that you edit your Lisp programs and make sure that you always use
<TT>nil</TT> for false and <TT>()</TT> for the empty list; LTD will
then work smoothly. You should also make sure that you consistently
use the function <TT>null</TT> to check for the empty list, and
<TT>not</TT> to check for false.  If you don't want to follow this
advice, LTD provides <A HREF="tool.html#options">options</A> you can
set.<P>

There is a similar problem that <TT>t</TT> in Lisp is both a symbol and
the canonical true value, while <TT>#t</TT> in Dylan is not a symbol.
This does not cause as much confusion, so LTD ignores the problem.

<H2><A NAME="2names">Single versus multiple namespaces</A></H2>

In Dylan there is a single namespace associating variable names with
objects of all kinds.  For example, the variable name <TT>$pi</TT>,
the function name <TT>reverse</TT> and the class name
<TT>&lt;list&gt;</TT> are all in this single namespace.  It is
possible to subdivide this namespace into modules, but that is a <A
HREF="#packages">separate issue</A>.  In Lisp, there is one name space for
variables, another for function names, and a third for data types.
The symbol <TT>list</TT> has one value as a function, another as a
type, and is free to be given yet another as a variable.  <p>

So there are two problems: (1) doing an analysis to tell which way
<TT>list</TT> (or <TT>'list</TT>) is intended to be used, and (2)
deciding what to do when <TT>list</TT> is used in what to Dylan is
several different ways.  LTD address part of problem (1): it makes
choices based on the function to which an expression is an argument.
For example, consider the following conversions of <TT>list</TT> 
done by LTD:

<PRE>
LISP                         DYLAN
(coerce x 'list)             as(&lt;list&gt;, x)
(mapcar 'list args)          map(list, args)
(list 'list)                 list(#"list")
</PRE>

These are possible because LTD knows that the second argument to <TT>coerce</TT> is a type,
and the first argument to <TT>mapcar</TT> is a funcion.<p>

But there are some cases
where conversions like this cannot be done automatically.  Consider <TT>(setq var
'list)</TT>.  This should be translated as <TT>var := list</TT> if the
variable is used later in <TT>(funcall var 1 2 3)</TT>; it should be
translated as <TT>var := &lt;list&gt;</TT> if the variable is used in
<TT>(coerce x var)</TT>, and it should be translated as <TT>var :=
#"list"</TT> in other cases.  But in general, deciding where a
variable will be used is undecidable.  So LTD does not even attempt to
do non-local analysis.  By default, <TT>'list</TT> translates as the
symbol <TT>#"list"</TT> and <TT>list</TT> translates as the variable
<TT>list</TT>. This means that LTD will make mistakes in expressions
such as <TT>(let ((var 'list)) (funcall var x y))</TT> or <TT>(let
((list nil)) (list list))</TT>.

<H2><A NAME="special">Special (dynamic) variables</A></H2>

Lisp has special variables with dynamic scope.  Dylan does not have
this feature.  However, Harlequin has provided an extension,
<TT>fluid-bind</TT>, that implements variables with dynamic scope.
LTD uses fluid-bind for all variables whose name starts and ends with
an asterisk.

<H2><A NAME="optional">Optional arguments</A></H2>

Lisp allows both optional and keyword parameters.  Dylan allows only
keyword parameters.  It is easy enough to change <TT>(defun f (x
&amp;optional y) ...)</TT> to the Dylan equivalent of <TT>(defun f (x
&amp;key y) ...)</TT>, and it is even possible to change calls such as
<TT>(f 1 2)</TT> to <TT>(f 1 :y 2)</TT>, assuming that two passes
through the code are allowed.  However, it is hard to know if anything
needs to be done to an expression such as <TT>(apply f l)</TT>,
because you don't know if <TT>f</TT> is a function that was defined to
take optional arguments.  LTD handles optional arguments in built-in
Common Lisp functions, but does not handle them for user-defined
functions; you will need to look carefully at calls to all functions
that take optional arguments.  Future versions of LTD may address this
issue.

<H2><A NAME="eval">EVAL and symbol-to-value coercion</A></H2>

Lisp has an <TT>eval</TT> function; Dylan does not.  Furthermore, Lisp has
other ways of getting some of the power of <TT>eval</TT>.  For
example, in <TT>(funcall (read) x)</TT>, the user can type any symbol
for the result of the <TT>read</TT>, and <TT>funcall</TT> will coerce
that symbol into a function to be called.  This capability is not
present in Dylan.  (Its absence means that one does not have to keep
all the defined functions in a Dylan object library, which is a very
good thing, but it does make translation difficult.)   <P>

This problem shows up in Lisp expressions such as <TT>(setq f
'nreverse)</TT>.  Whether this should translate as <TT>f :=
#"nreverse"</TT> or <TT>f := reverse!</TT> depends on how <TT>f</TT>
is subsequently used.  LTD takes the approach that symbols
will not be converted to functions, unless they appear in a function
argument position
that is known to take only functions.  If you meant to refer to the
function, you should write <TT>(setq f #'nreverse)</TT> in the source
code; this will get translated as <TT>f := reverse!</TT> as expected.
If you write <TT>(mapcar 'nreverse lists)</TT> or <TT>(funcall
'nreverse list)</TT> then LTD will convert
<TT>'nreverse</TT> to <TT>reverse!</TT>, but it will not do any more
complicated data-flow analysis.

<H2><A NAME="macros">Macros</A></H2>

Lisp provides complex user-defined macros that can run arbitrary code
before deciding on the expansion.  Dylan also provides a powerful
macro facility, but it is not quite as powerful as Lisp's.  Therefore,
it is not feasible to translate each <TT>defmacro</TT> from Lisp to
Dylan.  LTD thus requires you to write a <A
HREF="tool.html#ltd-fn"><TT>l2d-fn</TT></A> definition for each macro
in your program.  Future versions of LTD may automate this, but we are
waiting for the procedural macros to be defined.


<H2><A NAME="symbols">Lexical conventions for symbols, etc.</A></H2>

Variable names and symbols in Dylan are composed from numbers, digits,
and the characters "<TT>!&amp;*&lt;=&gt;|^$%@_</TT>".  They may not
start with "<TT>-+~?/</TT>".  If a variable starts with a digit, it
must contain two consecutive letters.  LTD alters symbols that do not
meet these conventions: it changes illegal characters to <TT>%</TT>.
It does not check to see if such changes will result in name clashes. <p>

In addition, note that in Lisp, <TT>|x|</TT> and <TT>|X|</TT> are two
different symbols, while in Dylan, <TT>x</TT> and <TT>X</TT> are the
same names, although <TT>#"x"</TT> and <TT>#"X"</TT> are different
symbol literals.  LTD currently does not deal with this problem.  

<H2><A NAME="numbers">Numbers</A></H2>

Dylan has a simpler number type hierarchy (and syntax for number
constants) than Lisp.  Dylan does not implement complex numbers
(although it reserves a place for them).  LTD prints <TT>#C(1 2)</TT>
as <TT>1 + 2 * $i</TT>, with the assumption that some library defines
the constant <TT>$i</TT> as <TT>sqrt(-1)</TT>.  Similarly, Dylan does
not define ratios, so LTD prints <TT>1/2</TT> as <TT>1 / 2</TT> within
code, but as <TT>0.5</TT> within a literal.  Dylan does not provide
the transcendental functions <TT>log</TT>, <TT>sin</TT>, etc. in the
core language, but rather puts them in a library, which has not yet
been specified.  LTD assumes that the function names are the same in
Lisp and Dylan.  Perhaps most importantly, Dylan is not yet explicit
about how bignums are used, and whether small integer arithmetic
overflows into bignums.  LTD does not deal with this problem, but you
may have to.

<H2><A NAME="packages">Packages versus modules</A></H2>

Lisp packages perform much of the same function as Dylan modules, but
packages are more dynamic.  LTD does not attempt to deal with
functions that access and alter packages at run time.  Future versions
may. <p>

One particular confusion is with the keyword package.  In Lisp, the
keyword package is just another package, although with the restriction
that all symbols in it are constants that evaluate to themselves.  But
all symbols, keyword or not, are first class objects.  In Dylan, there
is only one namespace of symbols, and several namespaces (modules) for
names, which get mapped into a single namespace by importing
assertions.  The syntax for a symbol is either <TT>#"symbol"</TT> or
<TT>symbol:</TT>, both are equivalent.  The latter syntax makes Dylan
symbols look like Lisp keywords (and they are used the same way in
parameter lists), but otherwise there is no symbol/keyword distinction
in Dylan.  Therefore, the safest thing is to convert Lisp's <TT>'(sym
:key)</TT> to <TT>#(#"user:sym" #"key")</TT>, although LTD also gives
you the option of converting this to <TT>#(#"sym" #"key")</TT> if you
know there will be no package/name conflicts.

<H2><A NAME="methods">CLOS method combination</A></H2>

Lisp allows for a lot of lattitude in the ways methods are defined and
combined.  One can specify the order on which parameters are tested
for dispatch.  One can defined <TT>:before</TT>, <TT>:after</TT> and
<TT>:around</TT> methods.  One can combine methods in customized ways.
Dylan does not allow any of this, or rather, it forces the programmer
to be responsible for it using <TT>call-next-method</TT>. LTD does not
attempt to deal with this; it just flags method qualifiers with a
warning.

<H2><A NAME="names">Functions with different names</A></H2>

Some functions have substantially the same definition in Lisp and
Dylan, but just have different names.  For example, <TT>cons</TT> in
Lisp is called <TT>pair</TT> in Dylan.  We provide a table of
translations of this kind in the file <A
HREF="../code/tables.lisp">tables.lisp</A>.  For example, the line

<PRE>
(ltd-fn cons pair)
</PRE> 

defines <TT>pair</TT> as the translation for the function
<TT>cons</TT>.  You may add new entries to this table by adding lines of the form

<PRE>
(cvt-fn <I>lisp-function</I> <I>dylan-function</I>)
</PRE> 

<H2><A NAME="similar">Functions with similar (but different) semantics</A></H2>

Some functions have similar semantics, but vary in minor detail.  For
example, the Lisp function <TT>length</TT> performs much the same
purpose as the Dylan function <TT>size</TT>, but there are
differences.  For one thing, <TT>size</TT> can give you the size of a
hashtable, while <TT>length</TT> will signal an error when applied to
a hashtable.  LTD substitutes <TT>size</TT> fro <TT>length</TT>
anyways, on the grounds that very few programs rely on signalling and
catching an error like this.  If your program does rely on such
behavior, you'll need to deal with it manually.  LTD always translates
<TT>length</TT> to <TT>size</TT>, via <TT>(ltd-fn length size)</TT>.
<p>

Another example is the function <TT>+</TT>, which is limited to two
arguments in Dylan, but takes any number in Lisp.  It is easy enough
to translate <TT>(+ a b c)</TT> to <TT>a + b + c</TT>, but what about
<TT>(apply #'+ args)</TT>? Currently, LTD translates this use of
<TT>#'+</TT> to <TT>+</TT>, which won't be right if <TT>args</TT> can
be other than a list of length two.<p>

The biggest example of similar functions is in the sequence functions.
For example, <TT>remove</TT> means much the same thing in Lisp and
Dylan, except that Lisp's <TT>remove</TT> takes more keyword arguments.
LTD has two approaches to handling this.  First, some calls can be
converted to the corresponding Dylan function.  For example,

<PRE>
(remove item seq :test-not #my= :key #'slot1 :start n)
</PRE>

will be translated by LTD to

<PRE>
remove!(item, copy-subsequence(seq, start: n),
        test: method (x, y) (complement(my=))(x, slot1(y)); end)
</PRE>

But this does not work so well in <TT>(apply #'remove args)</TT>,
because we don't know what keywords will be in <TT>args</TT>.  To
handle that, we have defined a library of functions that duplicate the
Common Lisp sequence functions (except that they don't support the
deprecated <TT>:test-not</TT> keyword).  These functions have names
like <TT>cl-remove</TT>.<p>

Another problem is <TT>error</TT>, and the other condition-signalling
functions.  In Lisp, they take an argum that can be either a format
string, an instance of a condition class, or the name of a condition
class.  The corresponding Dylan functions support the first two
options, but not the third.  LTD correctly translates <TT>(signal
'error)</TT> to <TT>(signal (make <error>))</TT>, but it translates
<TT>(apply #'signal args)</TT> to <TT>(apply signal args)</TT>, which
would be incorrect if a condition class name is provided.

A final problem is <TT>equalp</TT>, which has no direct equivalent in Dylan.
LTD maps it to <TT>==</TT>, which could cause problems.<p>


<H2><A NAME="missing">Functions that do not appear in Dylan</A></H2>

Common Lisp has several hundred functions that do not appear in Dylan
at all.  Some of these, like <TT>1+</TT> and <TT>cdar</TT> are easy
enough to replace with a simple inline Dylan expression.  LTD does that
with the following expressions:

<PRE>
(ltd-fn (1+ x)        `(+ ,x 1))
(ltd-fn (cdar x)      `(tail (head ,x)))
</PRE>

Other functions, such as <TT>rassoc</TT>, could be provided for in the
same way, or by a simple Lisp compatibility library written in Dylan.
They will be added on an as-needed basis.
Others, like <TT>eval</TT> or <TT>read</TT> would require an extensive
library, which remains to be written.<p>

Some functions have a half-hearted implementation in LTD.  For
example, LTD handles some of the simpler syntactic clauses in the
<TT>loop</TT> macro, but not all of them (there is an option to
macroexpand complex <TT>loop</TT>s, and then convert the result).
Similarly, LTD handles the easy format directives in format strings,
but not the complex ones.  (One could try to "macroexpand" the format
string using the <TT>formatter</TT> macro in Common Lisp.  LTD does
not do this because the results often are still not usable.)
